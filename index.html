      <h1>Rules 🫡</h1>
      <p>
        In the Pig game, the goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points.
        Players take turns rolling a single dice. On their turn, they can roll
        repeatedly, accumulating points as long as they don't roll a 1. If a
        player rolls a 1, they lose all the points they haven't banked that turn
        and their turn ends. After each roll, the player can decide to either
        roll again or stop and "bank" their points, adding them to their total
        score. The first player to reach or surpass 100 points wins the game.
        There are variations where players can agree on a different target score
        or add additional rules.
